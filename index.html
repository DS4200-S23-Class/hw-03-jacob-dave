                            <li>
                                This is a good mapping because the audience is able to see which state voted for which
                                political party, based off red being a Republican vote and blue being a Democratic vote.
                                Further, we are able to see the scale at which Clinton would have won due to a wave of
                                the color blue on our points (states).

                                This is a good mapping because without needing to add up the electoral votes per
                                political party, the audience can see a longer blue line and a significantly shorter
                                red line, further emphasizing the scale at which the Clinton would have won.

                                This is a good mapping because distinct categories (party) are different colors. These
                                colors also follow proper principal as they are perpetually distant and the same saturation.

                                This is a good mapping because the audience can see the launch angles that different

                                This is a good mapping because the audience can see the score of different points,
                                based on the color in the given gradient.

                                This is a good mapping because two colors (yellow and purple) are used to indicate extremes
                                of a range. These colors also follow proper principal as there is a neutral color (white)
                                in the middle. There is also no point in which there is a "no data" point, white on the
                                visualization is a midpoint.
